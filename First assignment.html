    <h1>The fundamental issue here is that JavaScript (ECMAScript) is a loosely typed language and it performs automatic type conversion on values to accommodate the operation being performed</h1>
    <script>
    console.log(1 + "2" + "2"); // it is concat as string
console.log(1 + +"2" + "2"); // 1st + makes 2 as string to integer. but second 2 is string. so it makes 32
console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");// 1st - makes 1 as string to integer. but second 2 is string. so it makes 02
console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2");// 1st - makes 1 as string to integer. and same behaviour of the first logging 112
console.log("A" - "B" + "2"); // - cannot used for string values. nor this reason find A - B is NAN and adding 2 as string.(NAN2)
    console.log("A"-"B"+2);// missing ""
